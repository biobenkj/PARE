{"name":"PARE","tagline":"PARE: a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements","body":"# Description\r\n\r\nPARE is a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements (enhancers and promoters). It exploits two important properties of active enhancer and promoter regions, which are:\r\n\r\n1. They are nucleosome depleted, therefore called as Nucleosome Free Regions (NFRs); and,\r\n2. The nucleosome flanking these regions are enriched for specific histone modifications. This enrichment in case of enhancer is H3K4me1 and in case of promoter is H3K4me3.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of above two properties, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 signal is arranged in the form of a peak-valley-peak (PVP) pattern at enhancers and promoters, respectively. PARE, in essence, captures this PVP-pattern, and predicts:\r\n\r\n1. Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me1 PVP pattern as active enhancers.\r\n2. Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3 PVP pattern as active promoters.\r\n\r\n# Input\r\n\r\nAs input, the pipeline requires two BAM files corresponding to two replicates of H3K4me1 (enhancer prediction) or H3K4me3 (promoter prediction) ChIP experiment.\r\n\r\nPARE can be executed simply by executing following command\r\n\r\npare -i <BAM file (rep1)> -j <BAM file (rep2)> [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\n# Output\r\n\r\nThe results from the PARESuite are presented in two text files:\r\n\r\na) RESULTS.TXT: main result file in BED format \r\n\r\nFor easy access, the html version of this file (RESULTS.HTML) is also available within the output directory\r\n\r\nb) RESULTS.UCSC: file to view the enhancer and promoter regions in UCSC browser\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nAn usage example of PARESuite is shown below. As input, the pipeline requires mapped reads in BAM format.
