{"name":"PARE","tagline":"PARE: a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements","body":"PARE is a computational method to predict active enhancers and promoters. It exploits the peak-valley-peak (PVP) pattern by which histone modifications are enriched at these regulatory elements. Specifically, at enhancers and promoters, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3-based PVP patterns are observed, respectively.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\n    PARE is a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements (enhancers and promoters). It implements a novel approach to detect Peak-Valley-Peak (PVP) pattern defined based on H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 signal at enhancers and promoters, respectively.\r\n\r\n    - Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me1 PVP pattern are predicted as active enhancers.\r\n\r\n    - Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3 PVP pattern are predicted as active promoters.\r\n\r\nVersion\r\n=======\r\n    0.02\r\n\r\nPrograms and datasets\r\n=====================\r\n    Generally, the user would be interested in following two scripts:\r\n\r\n    - pare: it is the main script to detect enhancers or promoters based on input BAM files (H3K4me1 - enhancers; H3K4me3 - promoters).\r\n\r\n    - bed2direction: this script is used to detect directionality of stable transcription at promoter regions, provided as input in BED format.\r\n\r\n    An example dataset and expected results are available at:\r\n\r\n    - http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\n    1. To install PARESuite, download PARESuite.tar.gz and unpack it. A directory, PARESuite will be created\r\n\r\n        tar -zxvf PARESuite.tar.gz\r\n\r\n    2. Now compile and create executable blockbuster\r\n\r\n        make or make all\r\n\r\n    3. Export environment variable 'PAREPATH' containing path to PARESuite installation directory\r\n\r\n        export PAREPATH=<path to PARESuite installation directory>\r\n\r\n    4. Add 'PAREPATH' to your 'PATH' environment variable\r\n\r\n        export PATH=$PATH:$PAREPATH/bin\r\n\r\n    5. Add 'PAREPATH' to your 'PERL5LIB' environment variable\r\n\r\n        export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:$PAREPATH/share/perl/\r\n\r\n    To permanently add or update the environment variable(s), add the last three export commands in your ~/.bashrc file\r\n\r\nDependency\r\n==========\r\n\r\n    We assume that the following programming platforms are installed and working: perl, R, and gcc. Besides, following packages should be installed.\r\n\r\n    1. Install the needed perl modules\r\n\r\n        sudo cpan Tie::IxHash Statistics::Basic\r\n\r\n    2. R modules are installed by entering R (type R on the cmdline) and then enter the following three commands (follow the instructions on the screen):\r\n\r\n        install.packages(c(\"ggplot2\", \"gridExtra\", \"optparse\", \"randomForest\", \"e1071\"))\r\n\r\n        source(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\n\r\n        biocLite(c(\"DESeq\"))\r\n\r\n    3. download samtools from http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/1.2/samtools-1.2.tar.bz2/download, go to the download location and do\r\n\r\n        tar xjf samtools-1.2.tar.bz2\r\n\r\n        cd samtools-1.2\r\n\r\n        make -j10 prefix=$HOME install\r\n\r\n    4. download bedtools from https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases/download/v2.23.0/bedtools-2.23.0.tar.gz, go to the download location and do\r\n\r\n        tar xzf BEDTools.v2.23\r\n\r\n        cd bedtools-2.23.0/\r\n\r\n        make -j 10\r\n\r\n        cp bin/* $HOME/bin\r\n\r\n    5. download featureCounts (subread) from http://sourceforge.net/projects/subread/files/subread-1.4.6-p4/, go to the download location and do\r\n\r\n        tar xzf subread-1.4.6-p4-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz\r\n        \r\n        cd subread-1.4.6-p3-Linux-x86_64\r\n        \r\n        cp bin/featureCounts $HOME/bin\r\n\r\n    6. download bedGraphToBigWig from http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/ for your operating system, go to the download location and do\r\n\r\n        cp bedGraphToBigWig $HOME/bin\r\n\r\n        chmod 755 $HOME/bin/bedGraphToBigWig\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\n    PARESuite is called with the following parameters\r\n\r\n    pare -i <BAM file (rep1)> -j <BAM file (rep2)> [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\nExample\r\n=======\r\n\r\n    An usage example of PARESuite is shown below. As input, the pipeline requires mapped reads in BAM format. An example dataset and expected results are available at http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/\r\n\r\n    pare -i data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep1.bam -j data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep2.bam -k data/optimal.h3k4me1_helas3_Rep0_Vs_control_helas3_Rep0.regionPeak.gz -o results -m hg19 -p &> pare.log\r\n\r\nInput\r\n=====\r\n\r\n    As input, the pipeline requires mapped reads in BAM format. The name of the input files should be formatted as\r\n\r\n    Input file name (replicate 1): <unique id><Rep1>.bam (example: h3k4me1_Rep1.bam)\r\n\r\n    Input file name (replicate 2): <unique id><Rep2>.bam (example: h3k4me1_Rep2.bam)\r\n\r\n    The chromosome identifier in the input BAM files should start with chr, for example as chrY and not like Y.\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n======\r\n\r\n    The results from the PARESuite are presented in two text files:\r\n\r\n    a) RESULTS.TXT: main result file in BED format \r\n\r\n    For easy access, the html version of this file (RESULTS.HTML) is also available within the output directory\r\n\r\n    b) RESULTS.UCSC: file to view the enhancer and promoter regions in UCSC browser\r\n\r\nMore info\r\n=========\r\n\r\n    for more and latest information, please refer to https://github.com/spundhir/pare or http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/ \r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n    PARE: a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements using histone marks\r\n    Copyright (C) 2015  Sachin Pundhir (pundhir@binf.ku.dk)\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
