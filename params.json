{"name":"PARE","tagline":"PARE: a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements","body":"# Description\r\n\r\nPARE is a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements (enhancers and promoters). It exploits two important properties of active enhancer and promoter regions, which are:\r\n\r\n    1. They are nucleosome depleted, therefore called as Nucleosome Free Regions (NFRs); and,\r\n    2. The nucleosome flanking these regions are enriched for specific histone modifications, which\r\n       in case of enhancer is H3K4me1 and in case of promoter is H3K4me3.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the above two properties, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 signal is distinctly arranged in the form of a peak-valley-peak (PVP) pattern at enhancers and promoters, respectively. PARE, in essence, captures this PVP-pattern, and predicts:\r\n\r\n    1. Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me1 PVP pattern as active enhancers.\r\n    2. Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3 PVP pattern as active promoters.\r\n\r\n# Input\r\n\r\nAs input, the pipeline requires two BAM files corresponding to two replicates of H3K4me1 (enhancer prediction) or H3K4me3 (promoter prediction) ChIP experiment.\r\n\r\nPARE can be executed simply by issuing following command\r\n\r\n    pare -i <BAM file (replicate 1)> -j <BAM file (replicate 2)> [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\n# Output\r\n\r\nThe results from the PARESuite are presented in two text files:\r\n\r\n    a) RESULTS.TXT: main result file in BED format. Each line represents the genomic coordinate of \r\n       an active enhancer or promoter.\r\n\r\nFor easy access, the html version of this file (RESULTS.HTML) is also available within the output directory\r\n\r\n    b) RESULTS.UCSC: file to view the enhancer and promoter regions in UCSC browser\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nAn usage example of PARESuite is shown below. As input, the pipeline requires mapped reads in BAM format. An example dataset and expected results are available at http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/\r\n\r\n    pare -i data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep1.bam -j data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep2.bam -k \\\r\n    data/optimal.h3k4me1_helas3_Rep0_Vs_control_helas3_Rep0.regionPeak.gz -o results \\\r\n    -m hg19 -p &> pare.log\r\n\r\n# More info\r\n\r\nFor more and latest information, please refer to https://github.com/spundhir/pare or http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/ \r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n    PARE: a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements using histone marks\r\n    Copyright (C) 2015  Sachin Pundhir (pundhir@binf.ku.dk)\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
