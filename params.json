{"name":"PARE","tagline":"PARE: a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements","body":"# Description\r\n\r\nPARE is a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements (enhancers and promoters). It implements a novel approach to detect Peak-Valley-Peak (PVP) pattern defined based on H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 signal at enhancers and promoters, respectively.\r\n\r\n    - Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me1 PVP pattern are predicted as active enhancers.\r\n\r\n    - Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3 PVP pattern are predicted as active promoters.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n    PARESuite is called with the following parameters\r\n\r\n    pare -i <BAM file (rep1)> -j <BAM file (rep2)> [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\n    An usage example of PARESuite is shown below. As input, the pipeline requires mapped reads in BAM format. An example dataset and expected results are available at http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/\r\n\r\n    pare -i data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep1.bam -j data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep2.bam -k data/optimal.h3k4me1_helas3_Rep0_Vs_control_helas3_Rep0.regionPeak.gz -o results -m hg19 -p &> pare.log\r\n\r\nInput\r\n=====\r\n\r\n    As input, the pipeline requires mapped reads in BAM format. The name of the input files should be formatted as\r\n\r\n    Input file name (replicate 1): <unique id><Rep1>.bam (example: h3k4me1_Rep1.bam)\r\n\r\n    Input file name (replicate 2): <unique id><Rep2>.bam (example: h3k4me1_Rep2.bam)\r\n\r\n    The chromosome identifier in the input BAM files should start with chr, for example as chrY and not like Y.\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n======\r\n\r\n    The results from the PARESuite are presented in two text files:\r\n\r\n    a) RESULTS.TXT: main result file in BED format \r\n\r\n    For easy access, the html version of this file (RESULTS.HTML) is also available within the output directory\r\n\r\n    b) RESULTS.UCSC: file to view the enhancer and promoter regions in UCSC browser\r\n\r\nMore info\r\n=========\r\n\r\n    for more and latest information, please refer to https://github.com/spundhir/pare or http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/ \r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n    PARE: a computational pipeline to Predict Active Regulatory Elements using histone marks\r\n    Copyright (C) 2015  Sachin Pundhir (pundhir@binf.ku.dk)\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
