<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h1>

<p>PARE is a computational pipeline to <u><b>P</b></u>redict <u><b>A</b></u>ctive <u><b>R</b></u>egulatory <u><b>E</b></u>lements, specifically enhancers and promoters.

<h1>
<a id="advantage" class="anchor" href="#advantage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why use PARE?</h1>

<p>For predicting enhancers and promoters, PARE offers following advantages over available methods:</p>
<ol>
    <li>It can be used for cell types where <u>limited ChIP-seq data</u> is available (H3K4me1 or H3K4me3). This may be due to low amount of sample or high cost. PARE uses only single histone mark (H3K4me1 or H3K4me3) for its predictions.</li>
    <li>It predicts enhancers and promoters with <u>high specificity</u> for their activity. This is because PARE uses robust indicator of activity in the form of PVP pattern for its predictions</li>
    <li>Due to above two advantages, PARE is very efficient in <u>studying dynamics in the activity</u> of enhancers or promoters across different cell types or time points for which only H3K4me1/me3 data is available</li>
    <li>PARE also include a model to predict <u>directionality of stable transcription</u> at promoters. This can be done using the same H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 data that was used for the prediction of enhancers and promoters, respectively.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="working" class="anchor" href="#working" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works?</h1>
PARE exploits two important properties of active enhancer and promoter regions, which are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>They are nucleosome depleted, therefore called as Nucleosome Free Regions (NFRs); and,</li>
    <li>The nucleosome flanking these regions are enriched for distinct histone modifications, which in case of enhancers is H3K4me1 and in case of promoters is H3K4me3.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a consequence of the above two properties, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 signal is distinctly arranged in the form of a peak-valley-peak (PVP) pattern at enhancers and promoters, respectively. PARE, in essence, captures this PVP-pattern, and predicts:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me1 PVP pattern as active enhancers.</li>
    <li>Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3 PVP pattern as active promoters.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="input" class="anchor" href="#input" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Input</h1>

<p>As input, the pipeline requires two <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bam.html" target="_blank">BAM</a> files corresponding to two replicates of H3K4me1 (enhancer prediction) or H3K4me3 (promoter prediction) ChIP experiment.</p>

<p>PARE can be executed simply by issuing following command</p>

<pre><code>pare -i &lt;BAM file (replicate 1)&gt; -j &lt;BAM file (replicate 2)&gt; [OPTIONS]
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a id="output" class="anchor" href="#output" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Output</h1>

<p>The results from the PARESuite are presented in two text files:</p>

<pre><code>a) RESULTS.TXT: main result file in BED format. Each line represents the genomic coordinate of 
   an active enhancer or promoter.
</code></pre>

<p>For easy access, the html version of this file (RESULTS.HTML) is also available within the output directory</p>

<pre><code>b) RESULTS.UCSC: file to view the enhancer and promoter regions in UCSC browser.
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h1>

<p>An usage example of PARESuite is shown below. As input, the pipeline requires mapped reads in BAM format. An example dataset and expected results are available at <a href="http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/">http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/</a></p>

<pre><code>pare -i data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep1.bam -j data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep2.bam -k \
data/optimal.h3k4me1_helas3_Rep0_Vs_control_helas3_Rep0.regionPeak.gz -o results \
-m hg19 -p &amp;&gt; pare.log
</code></pre>
